abstract={As lots of cities are facing a new baby boom in China and rural areas are facing a serious shortage of medical resources, China's maternal and child health care system is facing a lot of problems. In this paper we introduce an intelligent information system for maternal and child health care based on Body area networks and Cloud computing technologies. Wearable sensors are used for detecting physical signs. Cloud computing and data mining technologies is used for fast data processing and medical models design. First, we will give a detailed introduction about the system design. Second, the system architecture will be carefully explained. Third, we will introduce an implementation of the system. At last, we will give a conclusion about our current work and introduce our future research directions.},
